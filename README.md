# Gabriel Moreno

I'm Gabriel, from 🇻🇪 &mdash; your trusted software engineer.

## What I do

I'm a software engineer & full-stack web developer specialized in <u>commercial projects</u>, <u>startup creations</u>, <u>corporate identity</u>, and personal websites. My job is to bring ideas to life through dynamic client-developer experiences, working as a team to transform amazing ideas into exceptional realities.

## What I also do

When I'm not developing commercial applications, I'm working on <u>personal & open source projects</u>, as well as mentoring beginner programmers and students with an awesome team at <u>The Electric Hive</u>; but the most important thing is, I'm always discovering, learning, and improving, one day at a time.

## The technologies I use

You'll often see me using my preferred tech stack, which consists of:

- ⚛️ **React** (front-end library of choice).
- 📱 **React Native** (for mobile applications).
- 🐝 **Node.js** (with Express for back-end development).
- 📦 **AWS** (for overall system infrastructure).
- 🐬 **MySQL** (for relational databases).
- 🍃 **MongoDB** (for NoSQL databases).

Although I can also (and usually) work with:

- 🐍 **Python** (with TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Django, Flask).
- 💎 **Ruby** (on Rails, for full-stack applications & backend services).
- 🐘 **PHP** (using Laravel & Bango — my framework).
- ☕️ **Java** (through AWT for graphical applications).
- ➕ **C++** (for data structures & algorithms, machine learning).

Last (but not least), I work pretty well too on the following environments and/or solutions:

- 🎱 **8base** as a backend-as-a-service provider (with GraphQL).
- 🔥 **Firebase** (and Google Cloud Platform for real-time applications).
