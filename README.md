# Gabriel Moreno

I'm Gabriel, from 🇻🇪 &mdash; your trusted software engineer.

## What I do

I'm a software engineer & full-stack web developer specialized in <u>commercial projects</u>, <u>startup creations</u>, <u>corporate identity</u>, and personal websites. My job is to bring ideas to life through dynamic client-developer experiences, working as a team to transform amazing ideas into exceptional realities.

## What I also do

When I'm not developing commercial applications, I'm working on <u>personal & open source projects</u>, as well as mentoring beginner programmers and students with an awesome team at <u>The Electric Hive</u>; but the most important thing is, I'm always discovering, learning, and improving, one day at a time.

## The technologies I use

You'll often see me using my preferred tech stack, which consists of:

-   **️⚛️ React** (frontend library of choice).
-   **📱 React Native** (for mobile applications).
-   **🎱 8base** as a backend-as-a-service provider (with GraphQL).

Although I can also (and usually) work with:

-   **🐝 Node.js** (with Express for backend development).
-   **🔥 Firebase** (for real-time data).
-   **🐍 Python** (with TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Django, Flask).
-   **🐘 PHP** (using Laravel & Bango — my framework).
-   **☕️ Java** (through AWT for graphical applications).
-   **➕ C++** (for data structures & algorithms, machine learning).
-   **🍃 MongoDB** (NoSQL databases).
-   **🐬 MySQL** (for relational databases).
