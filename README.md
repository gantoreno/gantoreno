# Gabriel Moreno

I'm Gabriel, from 🇻🇪, your trusted software engineer.

## What I do

I'm a software engineer & full-stack web developer specialized in <u>commercial projects</u>, <u>startup creations</u>, <u>corporate identity</u>, and personal websites. My job is to bring ideas to life through dynamic client-developer experiences, working as a team to transform amazing ideas into exceptional realities.

## What I also do

When I'm not developing commercial applications, I'm working on <u>personal & open source projects</u>, as well as mentoring beginner programmers and students with an awesome team at <u>The Electric Hive</u>; but the most important thing is, I'm always discovering, learning, and improving, one day at a time.

## The technologies I use

You'll often see me using my preferred tech stack, which consists of:

-   <strong>️⚛️ React</strong> (frontend library of choice).
-   <strong>📱 React Native</strong> (for mobile applications).
-   <strong>🎱 8base</strong> as a backend-as-a-service provider (with GraphQL).

Although I can also (and usually) work with:

-   <strong>🐝 Node.js</strong> (with Express for backend development).
-   <strong>🔥 Firebase</strong> (for real-time data).
-   <strong>🐍 Python</strong> (with TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Django, Flask).
-   <strong>🐘 PHP</strong> (using Laravel & Bango — my framework).
-   <strong>☕️ Java</strong> (through AWT for graphical applications).
-   <strong>➕ C++</strong> (for data structures & algorithms, machine learning).
-   <strong>🍃 MongoDB</strong> (NoSQL databases).
-   <strong>🐬 MySQL</strong> (for relational databases).
